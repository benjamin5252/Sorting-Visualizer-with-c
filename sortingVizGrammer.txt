A sorting animated visualization tool is built in extension.

The grammar for input file is shown below:

<MAIN> ::= "{" <INSTRCTLST>
<INSTRCTLST> ::= <INSTRUCTION><INSTRCTLST> | "}"
<INSTRUCTION> ::= <SET> | <SORT>
<SET> ::= "SET" "{" <SETINSTRCTLST>
<SETINSTRCTLST> ::= <SETINSTRCT><SETINSTRCTLST> | "}"
<SETINSTRCT> ::= <HEIGHT> | <WIDTH> | <COLOR> | <TYPE> | <X> | <Y> | <DELAY>
<HEIGHT> ::= "HEIGHT" <NUM>   /* set the height of the data unit of bar chart */
<WIDTH> ::= "WIDTH" <NUM>   /* set the width of the bar in bar chart */ 
<COLOR> ::= "COLOR" <enum_COLOR>   /* set the drawing color of the bar chart */
<TYPE> ::= "TYPE" <enum_TYPE>   /* set the sorting type */
<X> ::= "X" <NUM>   /* set the X offset of the entired bar chart */
<Y> ::= "Y" <NUM>   /* set the Y offset of the entired bar chart */
<DELAY> ::= "DELAY" <NUM>   /* set the time delay between each step of sorting */
<enum_COLOR> ::= "WHITE" | "RED" | "GREEN" | "BLUE"
<enum_TYPE> ::= "BUBBLE" | "MERGE" | "QUICK"
<SORT> ::= "SORT" "{" <NUMLST>
<NUMLST> ::= <NUM><NUMLST> | "}"
<NUM> ::= integer number  

In the tool, three types of sorting methods is implemented.
The visualization can be adjusted by various parameters, 
which is shown in the commands after the grammar.
The sample input data is in the "SortData" folder.
To run the program, type command "./extension SortData/filename.srt"

The test of this program is performed through the _test().
The parameter settings and sorting functions are all tested.
The error in the input data are tested by the error_code updated during the parsing.

error_code listed below:

Parse_OK : The input file is conformed to the grammar  
error_BEGIN : The "{" as the entry of the program is missing 
error_INSTRUCTION : The <INSTRUCTION> input is wrong 
error_SET : There is no "{" after "SET" 
error_RBRACE : The amount of "}" is wrong
error_SETINSTRCT : The <SETINSTRCT> in the seting part is wrong
error_COLOR : The input <enum_COLOR> is not defined in the tool
error_TYPE : The input <enum_TYPE> is not defined in the tool
error_SORT : There is no "{" after "SORT"
error_NUM : The input is not a number which can be stored in integer
error_CNUM : The amount of the input number exceed the maximun setting of the tool
