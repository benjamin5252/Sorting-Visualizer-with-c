The test is performed in the _test() function in each program. 

The errors in input program is detected
by asserting the error_codes updated during parsing.
Which is performed in both interp.c and parse.c.

Error_codes Description:
Parse_OK : The input file is Completely conform to the grammar
error_BEGIN : The input file miss the "{" as the entry of the program
error_INSTRUCTION : There is a wrong instruction in the program
error_DO : There is something wrong in the "DO <VAR> FROM <VARNUM> TO <VARNUM> {}" grammar
error_SET : ":=" is missing in the "SET <VAR> := <POLISH>" grammar
error_VAR : The format of <VAR> is not a uppercase character
error_RBRACE : The amount of "}" is not right in the program
error_VAR_notset : There is a use of unset variable in the program

In interp.c a ferther test for the functions of
<POLISH>, <DO>, stack, and data storage are perfomed.
